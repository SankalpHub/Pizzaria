# Pizza Time

I designed and built a full-stack food ordering platform for the gastronomy industry using React, Express.js, and Turso (libSQL).

- Dynamic UI: Features a fictional restaurant with pizzas, sushi, and pasta. Built with React Router, Icons, Carousels, and Framer Motion for smooth navigation and animations.

- Fast & Clean Browsing: Used React Paginate and Lazy Load for faster menu browsing and performance.

- Secure & Scalable: Managed user data and menu items with UUID and Turso (SQLite).

- Cart + Auth System: Express.js backend handles user login/register, profile updates, and reCAPTCHA-protected contact & registration form.

A fun, performance-optimized food app where great UX meets real tech.
